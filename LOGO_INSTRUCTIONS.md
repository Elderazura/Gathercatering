# Logo Files - Important!

Your logo files are **missing** from the project. Please add them to the correct location.

## Required Logo Files

Add these 3 logo files to: `public/logos/`

1. **Logo_Green.png** - Used in navigation (top of page)
2. **Logo_white.png** - Used in footer (bottom of page)  
3. **Logo_Brown.png** - Available for secondary use

## How to Add Your Logos

1. Copy your logo files
2. Paste them into the `gather-catering/public/logos/` folder
3. Make sure the filenames match EXACTLY:
   - `Logo_Green.png` (capital L, capital G)
   - `Logo_white.png` (capital L, lowercase w)
   - `Logo_Brown.png` (capital L, capital B)

## File Format

The logos should be:
- PNG format (recommended for transparency)
- Or SVG format (will need to update file extensions in code)

## After Adding Logos

Once you add the files, refresh your browser and the logos will appear automatically!

## Current Status

⚠️ **The website will show text fallback "Gather Cater" until logo files are added.**
